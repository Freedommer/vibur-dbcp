  running Vibur DBCP into an OSGi container, and may also be helpful if Vibur DBCP is used in an
  Apache Tomcat web application.
* Vibur DBCP JNDI ObjectFactory implemented.
* name (of the DataSource) and enableJMX config properties added.
* loginTimeout config property added (used for DriverManager or external DataSource configuration).

* Various other small enhancements and bug fixes.
