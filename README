=== Quick Introduction ===

The development of Vibur DBCP was originally inspired by the Spring JMS caching connection factory which is implemented
using Java dynamic proxies. The main goal was to create a standalone and fully-featured JDBC Connection pool,
which is at the same time as simple as possible, has concise and easy to maintain source code (based on dynamic proxies),
has as fewer as practical external dependencies, and follows the design principle of having a separate and dedicated
[https://code.google.com/p/vibur-object-pool/ object pool].

==== Most important features and characteristics: ====

  * Built using the standard Java concurrent utilities, does not use any direct synchronization.
  * Supports fairness parameter, which when set to true, guarantees that threads invoking the pool's `take` methods will be selected to obtain a connection from it in FIFO order, and no thread is starved out from accessing the pool's underlying resources.
  * Caching support for JDBC Statements (Prepared and Callable).
  * SQL queries logging & getConnection() calls logging depending on the execution time taken.

  * Hibernate integration support.

==== Other features: ====

  * Validation intervals support, i.e. the taken from the pool connection is not validated before every use but is validated only if given time interval has passed since the last time the connection was used.
  * Intelligent pool's sizing - the number of idle connections in the pool will be reduced based on heuristics for the number of connections which were recently used.
  * The underlying JDBC Connection or Statement object can be retrieved from the respective proxy object via calling the proxy's `unwrap` method.
  * Ability to provide records for all JDBC Connections which are currently taken, including the stack traces with which they have been taken. Useful if debugging lost (not closed) connections.

  * The only external dependencies which Vibur DBCP has are: vibur-object-pool, slf4j, and ConcurrentLinkedHashMap. The CLHM dependency can be excluded if the JDBC Statements caching is not needed.
  * JMX support - the pool registers an MBean via which various pool's parameters can be observed and/or set.

==== Trade-offs: ====

  * Alternate user names and password are not supported yet. The call to `DataSource.getConnection(username, password)` will simply create and return connection using the configured default username and password.
  * Creating the initial connections for the pool from an existing DataSource is not implemented yet.

=== Usage Examples ===

==== Maven dependency: ====

  * coming soon...

==== Hibernate configuration example: ====

{{{
<hibernate-configuration>
    <session-factory>
        <!-- Database connection settings: -->
        <property name="hibernate.connection.driver_class">org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver</property>
        <property name="hibernate.connection.url">jdbc:hsqldb:mem:sakila;shutdown=false</property>
        <property name="hibernate.connection.username">sa</property>
        <property name="hibernate.connection.password"></property>

        <property name="hibernate.dialect">org.hibernate.dialect.HSQLDialect</property>

        <property name="hibernate.current_session_context_class">thread</property>

        <!-- Vibur DBCP specific properties: -->
        <property name="hibernate.connection.provider_class">
            org.vibur.dbcp.integration.ViburDBCPConnectionProvider
        </property>
        <property name="hibernate.vibur.poolInitialSize">10</property>
        <property name="hibernate.vibur.poolMaxSize">100</property>
        <property name="hibernate.vibur.connectionIdleLimitInSeconds">30</property>

        <property name="hibernate.vibur.statementCacheMaxSize">200</property>
    </session-factory>
</hibernate-configuration>
}}}

==== Programmatic configuration example: ====

{{{
    public ViburDBCPDataSource createDataSourceWithStatementsCache() {
        ViburDBCPDataSource ds = new ViburDBCPDataSource();

        ds.setDriverClassName("org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver");
        ds.setJdbcUrl("jdbc:hsqldb:mem:sakila;shutdown=false");
        ds.setUsername("sa");
        ds.setPassword("");

        ds.setPoolInitialSize(10);
        ds.setPoolMaxSize(100);
        ds.setConnectionIdleLimitInSeconds(30);
        ds.setLogQueryExecutionLongerThanMs(100);
        ds.setStatementCacheMaxSize(200);

        ds.start();

        return ds;
    }
}}}

=== Configuration Options ===

==== Basic database connection settings: ====
|| *Attribute* || *Description* || *Default value* ||
|| `driverClassName` || Database driver class name. || Supplied by user ||
|| `jdbcUrl` || Database JDBC Connection string. || Supplied by user ||
|| `username` || User name to use. || Supplied by user ||
|| `password` || Password to use. || Supplied by user ||

==== Database connection validation settings: ====
|| *Attribute* || *Description* || *Default value* ||
|| `connectionIdleLimitInSeconds` || If the connection has stayed in the pool for at least `connectionIdleLimitInSeconds`, it will be validated before being given to the application using the `testConnectionQuery`. If set to zero, will validate the connection always when it is taken from the pool. If set to a negative number, will never validate the taken from the pool connection. || `60` ||
|| `testConnectionQuery` || Used to test the validity of the JDBC Connection. Should be set to a valid query if the `connectionIdleLimitInSeconds` is set to a non-negative number. || `SELECT 1` ||

==== Basic pool size, growth and fairness settings: ====
|| *Attribute* || *Description* || *Default value* ||
|| `poolInitialSize` || The pool initial size, i.e. the initial number of JDBC Connections allocated in this pool. || `10` ||
|| `poolMaxSize` || The pool max size, i.e. the maximum number of JDBC Connections allocated in this pool. || `100` ||
|| `poolFair` || The pool's fairness setting with regards to waiting threads. || `true` ||
|| `poolEnableConnectionTracking` || If `true`, the pool will keep information for the current stack trace of every taken connection. || `false` ||

==== Database connection timeout and retries settings: ====
|| *Attribute* || *Description* || *Default value* ||
|| `createConnectionTimeoutInMs` || Time to wait before a call to getConnection() times out and returns an error `0` means forever. || `60000` ||
|| `acquireRetryDelayInMs` || After attempting to acquire a JDBC Connection and failing with an `SQLException`, wait for this long time before attempting to acquire a new JDBC Connection again. || `1000` ||
|| `acquireRetryAttempt` || After attempting to acquire a JDBC Connection and failing with an `SQLException`, try to connect these many times before giving up. || `3` ||

==== Database statements caching settings: ====
|| *Attribute* || *Description* || *Default value* ||
|| `statementCacheMaxSize` || Defines the maximum statement cache size. `0` disables it, max values is `1000`. If the statement's cache is not enabled, the client application may safely exclude the dependency on ConcurrentLinkedCacheMap. || `0` ||

==== Database connections and SQL queries logging settings ====
|| *Attribute* || *Description* || *Default value* ||
|| `logCreateConnectionLongerThanMs` || `getConnection` method calls taking longer than or equal to this time limit are logged at WARN level. A value of `0` will log all such calls. A `negative number` disables it. || `3000` ||

|| *Attribute* || *Description* || *Default value* ||
|| `resetDefaultsAfterUse` || If set to `true`, will reset the connection default values below, always after the connection is restored (returned) to the pool after use. If the calling application never changes these default values, resetting them is not needed. || `false` ||
|| `defaultAutoCommit` || The default auto-commit state of the created connections. || Driver's default ||
|| `defaultReadOnly` || The default read-only state of the created connections. || Driver's default ||
|| `defaultTransactionIsolation` || The default symbolic transaction isolation state of the created connections. || Driver's default ||
